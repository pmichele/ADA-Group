    "We utilised the several datasets available at https://github.com/bpb27/trump_tweet_data_archive which happens to automatically updata Trump's tweets every hour. All of the datasets are saved in json format and the data contained in them is the result of calls to the Twitter API. There are two varients, <b>master</b> which contains all of the original information from the API call and <b>condensed</b> which contains a lot less but essential information. After looking through some of the master and condensed datasets, we decided that the condensed datasets were sufficient as they contained the specfic fields we required (such as ...?) and the entries in master were unnecessarily large for our purpose (too much information that we would not use). <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We're using all of the condensed datasets from 2009 to 2017 because the tweet data isn't that time consuming to process and having as much data as possible will be beneficial when clustering the messages in the tweets. Since the 2017 datatset is continiously being updated, we are only using it up to a certain date (--/--/2017). All of the data in total is around 10 MB so it is really simple to handle and there is no need to rely on additional computing resources<br>\n",

    "Below, we import all the necessary libraries we need for extracting and combining the data. We iterate over each json file and turn them into a pandas DataFrame and store them in the list <b>data</b>. We do this so that later on we can simply combine them into one single dataframe."

    "<h2>Reply tweets data</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to do a sentiment analysis, we need to create a dataframe containing replies to Trump's tweets. To do this, we use the library Twarc which simplifies the API call process. Note that due to a limitation in the Twitter API, getting replies to a tweet is not a feature by default so you have to use a workaround. One thing that's commonly done is to use Twitter's search function, it would involve searching for all messages directed at Trump and then seeing which ones have a reply_id (the id of the tweet they are replying to) that is equal to a given Trump tweet id. The problem with this is that it is only able to look for replies to tweets that are max a wekk old. The second issue is that the amount of times that you can use the search function in the Twitter API is limited to a 100 queries an hour which is not ideal since it would take too long to get enough tweets to train our classifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we decided to do the following. We iterate over all of Trump's tweets, get the id of these tweets and then do a http request to the twitter page containing that tweet. Then we parse the page using BeautifulSoup and search for the attribute \"data-tweet-id\" in the HTML text. This attribute corresponds to an id of any tweet on that page which means that we can easily obtain the id of replies. Then, instead of using the search function in the Twitter API, we use a different method that can lookup tweet information given an id. This method is not limited to tweets that are more than 7 days old and has a higher rate limit. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are using the package Twarc and to use it we need authenticate it with keys and access tokens that can be obtained from the Twitter Dev website."

Note that we don't consider a value of None in <b>in_reply_to_user_id_str</b> to be a missing value as it's acceptable for a tweet to not reply to another. We make a copy of our original dataframe, drop the in_reply_to_user_id_str (because pandas think's that the value None is a null value in this case) and then do a query to return all entries with some form of missing value. As we can see, we get no entries in this case so all of the values are present."
