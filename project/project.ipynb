    "We utilised the several datasets available at https://github.com/bpb27/trump_tweet_data_archive which happens to automatically updata Trump's tweets every hour. All of the datasets are saved in json format and the data contained in them is the result of calls to the Twitter API. There are two varients, <b>master</b> which contains all of the original information from the API call and <b>condensed</b> which contains a lot less but essential information. After looking through some of the master and condensed datasets, we decided that the condensed datasets were sufficient as they contained the specfic fields we required and the entries in master were unnecessarily large for our purpose (too much information that we would not use). <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We're using all of the condensed datasets from 2009 to 2017 because the tweet data isn't that time consuming to process and having as much data as possible will be beneficial when clustering the messages in the tweets. Since the 2017 datatset is continiously being updated, we are only using it up to a certain date. All of the data in total is around 10 MB so it is really simple to handle and there is no need to rely on additional computing resources<br>\n",

    "Below, we import all the necessary libraries we need for extracting and combining the data. We iterate over each json file and turn them into a pandas DataFrame and store them in the list <b>data</b>. We do this so that later on we can simply combine them into one single dataframe."

    "\n",
    "In order to do a sentiment analysis, we need to create a dataframe containing replies to Trump's tweets. To do this, we use the library Twarc which simplifies the API call process. Note that due to a limitation in the Twitter API, getting replies to a tweet is not a feature by default so you have to use a workaround. One thing that's commonly done is to use Twitter's search function, it would involve searching for all messages directed at Trump and then seeing which ones have a reply_id (the id of the tweet they are replying to) that is equal to a given Trump tweet id. The problem with this is that it is only able to look for replies to tweets that are max a week old. The second issue is that the amount of times that you can use the search function in the Twitter API is limited to a 100 queries an hour which is not ideal since it would take too long to get enough tweets to train our classifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we decided to do the following. We iterate over all of Trump's tweets, get the id of these tweets and then do a http request to the twitter page containing that tweet. Then we parse the page using BeautifulSoup and search for the attribute \"data-tweet-id\" in the HTML text. This attribute corresponds to an id of any tweet on that page which means that we can easily obtain the id of replies. Then, instead of using the search function in the Twitter API, we use a different method that can lookup tweet information given an id. This method is not limited to tweets that are more than 7 days old and has a higher rate limit. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are using the package Twarc and to use it we need authenticate it with keys and access tokens that can be obtained from the Twitter Dev website."

We make a copy of our original dataframe, drop the in_reply_to_user_id_str (because pandas replcae the value None with a null value in this case) and then do a query to return all entries with some form of missing value. As we can see, we get no entries in this case so all of the values are present."

    "Clustering of tweets will be implemented via topic modeling, more specifically via Latent Dirichlet Allocation (in short LDA). In LDA the documents of a corpus are generated according to a mixture of (dirichlet) word distributions over a vocabulary of fixed size. Guiding intuition, such word distributions are named \"topics\". Each document is characterized by a per-document (dirichlet) topic distribution and a total number of words N. Each word of the document is generated by first sampling a topic assignment out of the per-document distribution and then by sampling a word out of the word distribution. The machine learning task is to backtrack this process to \"infer\" the latent topic distribution of the document. Given the model and the per-document distribution, a corpus can be fully characterized (up to words order, since documents are bag-of-words). This entails that if the number of topics K is s.t. K << D, where D is the length of the dictionary, then under LDA every document has a more succint representation."

    "Pre-processing has been performed iteratively: at each step, the output of simple functions and tokenization was analyzed seeking for the most occurring incorrect tokens. After determining the cause of the incorrect tokenization, a rule was written to fix it. This process was repeated until, after a thorough inspection, most of the tokens were meaningful. Particular care was devoted to this phase since the performance of clustering algorithms generally depends on the underlying data. The pre-processing includes: shifting to lower case, stripping links, dates and time. Punctuation was ignored except for \".\" and \"'\" since many proper names include these symbols (single or multiple periods are still ignored however). Other accepted symbols are \"@\" and \"#\" at the begin of a word. Stopwords are stripped out. Finally, stemming was applied, even though we found out some cases of ambiguity and reduced readability. We decided to deploy stemming anyway since the various verb conjugations such as \"said\" and \"say\" were a far bigger issue than some small inconvenience. Moreover, readability was maintained by keeping track of both processed and unprocessed tweets."

    "Right after feature pre-processing, a crucial step in clustering is determining the number of clusters. We started with a non-small number of topics (k = 100) attempting to first overfit the model to the training set (but still keeping a reasonable amount of topics for manual inspection) and then to progressively reduce the number of topics to increase performance. The goodness of fit was measured by first splitting in training and testing samples, inferring a test tweet's most probable topic and then assigning the tweet to that topic (hard clustering). However, this method seemed to be slow since every model seemed to derive small topics of approximately the same size (10 ~ 80 tweets each, where the biggest topic was 4% of the whole dataset). While selecting the number of clusters just so that the dataset would be nicely partitioned in bigger chunks was tempting, we were not sure whether a small cluster could still have a great impact in clustering. To this aim, many of the 100 topics were inspected and we found out that some topics were fairly similar (for example all topics addressing Ted Cruz were divided in several topics). \n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, our aim became minimizing the \"uncertainty\" of the per-tweet topic distributions (i.e. by having higher maxima). In order to do so, recall that in LDA a test sample document of D features is reduced to a K-vector in the K-topic space. We had the idea of computing the silhouette function in this space to improve goodness of fit. We decided to implement that using centroids (the average point of each cluster) and euclidian distance. Another test that would be interesting to make is to use the total variation distance since every point in the topic space is a probability distribution over K topics. A completely different approach that was implemented was to set the topic assignment zi as the center of the cluster. The total variation distance between a tweet and all zi is then simply 1 - di, where di is the i-th component of the tweet K-vector. This approach was not thoroghly tested but it seemed to produce similar results. As you may note below, the maximum silhouette value was achieved for k = 2. This behavior is certainly suspicious. Nonetheless, the resulting clusters seems to be of some use."

    "The two derived topics seems to have an interesting side-effect: the classifier acts as Trump's rant detector. It infers 1 when Trump attacks a controversial issue in his tweet, generally defending himself or belittling his opponents (Clinton, Obama, the Democrats, the FBI CEO...) in a manner that might resemble an angry rant, targeted to awaken people's anger. It is not unusual to read keywords such as \"FAKE NEWS\" or \"rigged system\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples: \n",
    "1. \"FAKE NEWS media knowingly doesn't tell the truth. A great danger to our country. The failing @nytimes has become a joke. Likewise @CNN. Sad!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. \"What is our country coming to when a judge can halt a Homeland Security travel ban and anyone, even with bad intentions, can come into U.S.?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. \"James Comey will be replaced by someone who will do a far better job, bringing back the spirit and prestige of the FBI.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "4. \"Karen Handle's opponent in #GA06 can't even vote in the district he wants to represent....\"\n",
    "\n",
    "5. \"Everybody is asking why the Justice Department (and FBI) isn't looking into all of the dishonesty going on with Crooked Hillary & the Dems.. \"\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, we observe a completely different pattern in the other cluster. Trump glorifies and thanks either his supporters, his government or even his family. He celebrates having met \"great people\" or festivities. In this cluster we observe a Trump that inspires people hope. Frequent keywords are \"honor\", \"hope\", \"pray\", \"God\", \"kind\", \"jobs\"...\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. \"My warmest condolences and sympathies to the victims and families of the terrible Las Vegas shooting. God bless you\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. \"Getting ready to celebrate the 4th of July with a big crowd at the White House. Happy 4th to everyone. Our country will grow and prosper! \"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. \"Today on #NationalAgDay, we honor our great American farmers & ranchers. Their hard work & dedication are ingrained…\"\n",
    "\n",
    "4. \"Thank you for such a wonderful and unforgettable visit, Prime Minister @Netanyahu and @PresidentRuvi.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "5. \"Nick Adams, \"Retaking America\"  \"Best things of this presidency aren't reported about. Convinced this will be perhaps best presidency ever.\" \"\n",
