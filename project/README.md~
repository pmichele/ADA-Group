# Title
Popularity and sentiment analysis of Trump's tweets across the world.

# Abstract
The main idea for this project is to study Trump's tweets in order to highlight positive and negative reactions depending on regions (or countries) in the world. This will be based on information in Trump's tweets: it might be country based (for example North Corea) or topic based (for example Obamacare). So Twitter's database (accessed via API) will be used extensively, studying retweets and likes in his tweets. Finally, the evolution of reactions to certain information will also be studied, based on the date of the tweets. The resulting analysis will be presented as a map, colored by reaction, fading to white when the number of reactions is low. This will help the viewer to spot relevant information: maybe countries in Europe react very differently compared to countries in Asia concerning a certain topic, or are not reacting at all.

# Research questions
Are Trump's tweets equally popular across countries?
Do countries show different sentiments in reaction to Trump's tweets?
Do we observe similar reactions to tweets that have the same topic?
How do the countries' reactions to a topic evolve over time? (may be unfeasible due to limits on download rates of data)

# Dataset
Trump's tweets dataset in the spreadsheet.
Any other information we can fetch through Twitter's API.

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
1. Getting data from Twitter
2. Classification of Trump's tweets by topic
3. Classify users' reaction to a topic by sentiment and country.
4. Plot a world map for each topic
5. Animate the evolution of the reactions to the topics over time
